h2. DESCRIPTION

ActiveRecord i18n Defaults is a Rails 2.3.2 plugin that lets you define translations for common attributes used in more that one model. 
You can use then in _ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper label_ method too.

h2. INSTALLATION

Install the plugin from your Rails project root:

<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/uchoaaa/activerecord_i18n_defaults.git</code></pre>

h2. USAGE

Define your ActiveRecord default attributes with "_all". 
In your translation file:

<pre><code>en-US:
  activerecord:
    attributes:
      _all:
        login: "Login"
		created_at: "Creation Date"
      admin:
        login: "Custom Login"</code></pre>

Then use the I18n API as usual. If an attribute for a model is not found, it will be searched in _all atributes.

In your view:

  <% form_for @user do |f| %>
    <%= f.label :created_at %>
  <% end %>

The result is:

  &lt;label for="topic_created_at">Creation Date</label> (please ignore the minor problem with html in github)
